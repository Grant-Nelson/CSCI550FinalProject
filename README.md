# CSCI 550 - Final Project

This is [Grant Nelson](https://github.com/Grant-Nelson) and [John Singleton](https://github.com/JohnSingleton54) final project at Montana State University 2019 for CSCI 550

**Disclamer:** The commits contain code from both Grant and John regardless of the committer.
This project has no connection to Workiva regardless of the committer.
(Grant committed both his and John's code from either his work or home computer, hence the committer name.)

## Getting Started

1. Download [FPA_FOD_20170508.sqlite](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) data
    - If is zipped on download, unzip here
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Then choose to run either Command Line or from Jupyter/Anaconda

### Running from Command Line

This method works for Linux and Mac. It also work for Windows if run from Visual Studio Code.

1. Install the following required packages:
    1. [numpy](https://scipy.org/install.html): Run `pip install numpy`
    2. [powerlaw](https://pypi.org/project/powerlaw/): Run `pip install powerlaw`
    3. The following packages are for the contourMap examples an may not work everywhere
        1. [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/): Run `pip install boken`
        2. [colorcet](https://colorcet.pyviz.org/): Run `pip install colorcet`
2. Run one of the following scripts
    1. `python checkSQL.py`
    2. `python contourMap0.py > mapData.csv`
    3. `python contourMap1.py`
    4. `python contourMap2.py`
    5. `python contourMap3.py`
    6. `python contourMap4.py`
    7. `python contourMap5.py > mapData.csv`
    8. `python sizeBucket1.py > sizeBucket1.csv`
    9. `python sizeBucket2.py > sizeBucket2.csv`
    10. `python powerlawFull.py`
    11. `python powerlawByState.py > byState.csv`
    12. `python powerlawByYear.py > byYear.csv`
    13. `python compareFull.py`
    14. `python compareByState.py > compareByState.txt`
    15. `python compareByYear.py > compareByYear.txt`
3. Some scripts output csv files which can be plotted with Google Sheets, Excel, or plot.ly

### Running from Jupyter/Anaconda

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
2. Install the following required packages using the Anaconda console
    1. [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/): Run `conda install bokeh`
    2. [colorcet](https://colorcet.pyviz.org/): Run `conda install -c bokeh colorcet`
    3. [powerlaw](https://pypi.org/project/powerlaw/): Run `conda install powerlaw`
3. Run scripts with Jupyter
